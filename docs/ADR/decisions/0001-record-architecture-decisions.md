# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2021-09-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

## Experience report

This is a nice tool, although it is worth considering alternatives in the form of [RFC specification](https://philcalcado.com/2018/11/19/a_structured_rfc_process.html)
