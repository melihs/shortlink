# 11. Application architecture documentation

Date: 2023-01-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to have a standard documentation for easy understanding of 
the logic of the platform and its architecture.

We research:
- [4C model](https://c4model.com/)
- 4+1 model
- ARC42
- archimate model
  - archi -> neo4j -> grafana
- PlantUML
  - PlantUML-C4
- OpenAPI specification
- Gherkin

## Decision

+ We use the [4C model](https://c4model.com/) for the documentation of the application architecture.
+ We use [archi editor](https://www.archimatetool.com/) for the documentation of the application architecture.

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.
