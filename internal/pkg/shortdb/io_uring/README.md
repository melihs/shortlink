### io_uring

Library for work with io_uring

### Pre-requisites

+ Install liburing in your machine from latest master. [https://github.com/axboe/liburing/](https://github.com/axboe/liburing/)
+ You need to have a modern (>=5.3) Linux kernel. It may work on older kernels too. But I have not tested it.
