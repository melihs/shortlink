# 1. Use CI/CD

Date: 2023-09-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We have a need for a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing and deployment of our services.

### History

Previously, we utilized Travis CI for our CI/CD needs. However, due to the discontinuation of their free version, 
we transitioned to the inferior-mentioned tools to better suit our requirements and budget constraints.

## Decision

| Tool/Service    | Purpose                                                   | Documentation Link                                       |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| GitHub Actions  | Base checks and dependency updates (via Dependabot)       | [GitHub Actions Docs](https://docs.github.com/actions)   |
| GitLab CI       | Full cycle: Testing and Building                          | [GitLab CI Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)         |
| ArgoCD          | Deployment of services                                    | [ArgoCD Docs](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) |


## Consequences

We are able to utilize the best of each tool to create a robust CI/CD pipeline.
